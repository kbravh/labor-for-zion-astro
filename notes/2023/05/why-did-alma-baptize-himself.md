In [[Mosiah 8.14]] we read about Alma gathering his followers at the [[Waters of Mormon]] so that they can be baptized. He proceeds to baptize Helam, the first man in line, but unexpectedly also submerges _himself_ in the water.

This surprising action raises the question: why would Alma immerse himself alongside Helam? Was he baptizing himself? Can people _do_ that? To understand this act, it’s crucial to recognize that Alma was already a member of the church. He had served as a priest under King Noah, and despite his previous wickedness, he still held the priesthood.

Given his existing membership and priesthood, we know that he didn't need to be baptized again. Alma’s submersion in the water, then, carries a symbolic meaning. Baptism represents the laying down of the natural man and being "born again". After a life of wickedness, Alma's submersion (while not an actual baptism) serves as a powerful symbolic gesture to emphasize his repentance and renewed dedication.
