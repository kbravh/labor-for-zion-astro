Anointing with olive oil is a Biblical practice that has been carried out since the times of Moses. What is the meaning of this anointing, and what significance does it hold for us today?

## Anointing in the Old Testament

In Old Testament times, prophets of the Lord anointed people who had important roles to play. Anointing acts as a consecration, or setting apart, of whoever or whatever is anointed.

The first references that we get to anointing with oil come from Exodus 29 and 30, where the Lord explains how the tabernacle should be built and consecrated to Him. In [[Exodus 30.22-29]], He explains how a mixture of oil and fragrances should be prepared to anoint the structures and utensils of the tabernacle. In [[Exodus 29.7]], we also learn that not only should the material parts of the tabernacle be anointed, but that Aaron and the priests should be anointed as well.

Later on in Israelite history, even the kings of Israel were anointed as they rose to their positions of leadership.

## Anointing in the New Testament

In [[Luke 7.46]], we read that Christ scolds a Pharisee for not anointing His head with oil after the Pharisee criticizes a woman for anointing Christ with perfume.

In Hebrew culture, hosts would anoint the head of honored guests with olive oil that had been mixed with a few drops of perfume. The oil was refreshing after the heat of the environment.

The Pharisee, by not offering this anointing to Christ, is denying him a common courtesy of the time and showing that he does not value Christ's company.

On a deeper, more significant level, one of Jesus' titles is "The Messiah", which means "The Annointed One". "Christ" also means the same thing; Messiah is Aramaic, Christ is Greek. Christ was anointed by our Heavenly Father to be the Savior of mankind.

## Modern day anointings

Today, in the church, we use anointings in a couple of situations. The first is when we anoint someone before a blessing of health. The second is when we are anointed in the temple.

Whenever we are annointed with oil in the temple, Christ is welcoming us as honored guests into his home. We become "anointed ones", tied to the symbolism of becoming [[Obadiah 1.21 1|saviors on mount Zion]].
