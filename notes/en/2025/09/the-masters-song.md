<div style="text-align: center;">
He who sings creation's chords<br>
Does call the stars of morning forward<br>
To dwell in mortal coil on<br>
The sphere wrought by His mighty song.<br>

Though trial's oft-sung sad refrain<br>
Brings shadows to this earthly plane,<br>
Redeeming light's sweet melody<br>
Does swell and make the blind to see<br>

Until this mortal verse draws nigh<br>
And sets the spirit free to fly<br>
To Him who penned such glorious tone<br>
To sing before His mighty throne.<br>

But soon another trumpet sounds<br>
Whose call destroys death's dreadful bounds.<br>
And all do rise and sing the hymn<br>
Of life eternal without end.<br>
