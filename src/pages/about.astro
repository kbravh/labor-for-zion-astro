          This site is maintained by me, Karey Higuera. I'm a software developer
          based out of Indianapolis, Indiana. I'm a member of the Church of Jesus
          Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
        </p>
        <p>
          I served a mission for the church from April 2015 - April 2017 in the
          Argentina Resistencia mission. I have a wife and young daughter, and I
          spend most of my time working, reading, gaming, and spending time with
          my family.
